# Fix My Code Challenge

Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge! This is a unique project where you will be tasked with fixing existing code in various programming languages. The goal is to identify and correct the issues in the provided codebase without rewriting everything from scratch. This challenge is optional but can greatly boost your project grade if completed successfully.

## Project Details
Weight: 1 (Contributes to your project grade)
Start Date: July 17, 2023, 6:00 AM
End Date: July 31, 2023, 6:00 AM
Checker Release: July 20, 2023, 6:00 PM
Auto Review Deadline: Deadline day at the specified end time

## Requirements
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compilation Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All files should end with a new line
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory

## How to Participate
Clone the GitHub repository Fix_My_Code_Challenge to your local machine.
Review the project tasks and the provided code for each task.
Identify and fix the issues in the codebase without rewriting the entire code.
Commit your changes and push them to your repository.
Verify that the code is working correctly after your fixes.

## Tasks

Something is wrong with the FizzBuzz implementation. The code should print numbers from 1 to the specified input n, but when n is a multiple of 3 and 5, it should print "FizzBuzz" instead. Please find the 0-fizzbuzz.py file in the 0x00-challenge directory and fix the issue.

## Task 1: Print Square
Language: JavaScript

There's a problem with the implementation of printing a square. The code should output a square of a given size, but it is not working correctly. Locate the 1-print_square.js file in the 0x00-challenge directory and fix the issue.

Task 2: Sort
Language: Ruby

The sorting algorithm implementation seems to be flawed. It should sort a list of integers passed as command-line arguments, but it is not producing the correct output. Check the 2-sort.rb file in the 0x00-challenge directory and fix the sorting issue.

Task 3: User Password
Language: Python

The implementation of the User class is causing errors when validating passwords. The is_valid_password method should return True if the input password matches the user's password, but it seems to be failing. Open the 3-user.py file in the 0x00-challenge directory and fix the password validation.

Task 4: Double Linked List
Language: C

The double linked list implementation is not behaving as expected. Some operations are not working correctly. Compile the code using the provided instructions and run the executable, delete_dnodeint, but it produces unexpected output. Locate and fix the issues in the 4-delete_dnodeint directory.

Submission
Once you have fixed the issues for each task, commit your changes and push them to your repository. The auto-review will take place at the specified deadline, and your fixes will be evaluated. You are encouraged to complete this challenge to improve your project grade, but remember that participation is entirely optional.

Have fun fixing the code and happy coding!
