# 0x00-challenge - Fix My Code Challenge

Welcome to the Fix My Code Challenge! This repository contains several programming tasks in different languages. Your goal is to identify and fix the issues in the provided code without rewriting everything from scratch.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific task. Inside each task directory, you will find the original code files that need to be fixed.

- Task 0: FizzBuzz (Language: Python)
- Task 1: Print Square (Language: JavaScript)
- Task 2: Sort (Language: Ruby)
- Task 3: User Password (Language: Python)
- Task 4: Double Linked List (Language: C)


## Requirements
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compilation Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All files should end with a new line
A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory

## How to Participate
Clone this GitHub repository, Fix_My_Code_Challenge, to your local machine.
Go to the specific task directory you want to work on.
Open the corresponding code file in your preferred editor (vi, vim, emacs).
Identify the issues causing incorrect behavior in the code.
Fix the code to make it work correctly for all test cases.
Test your fixed code thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected.


## Submission
After fixing the code for a specific task, commit your changes and push them to your repository. Make sure to keep the directory structure intact, and each task's code files are in their respective directories.

The auto-review for the challenge will take place at the specified deadline. Your fixes will be evaluated, and the correctness of your solutions will be determined.

Remember, participating in this challenge is optional, but it can significantly improve your project grade if completed successfully.

Have fun fixing the code, and happy coding!
